The Kaushalya Setu project was designed and launched to help grade 10 students who were unable to clear the matriculation exam. To make sure these students still enjoyed equal and quality access to higher education opportunities, 15 skilled bridge courses were conceptualized, where students were trained in various skill-based studies for a duration of 6 months. SAF trained 150 master trainers on effective counseling techniques for these students, ensuring that they enjoyed a smooth and positive transition from this phase in their lives to the next.
